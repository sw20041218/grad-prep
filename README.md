# Graduate Preparation Log

This repository documents my systematic preparation for graduate-level research in computer science.

The focus includes:
- Mathematical foundations
- Core computer science fundamentals
- Research-oriented machine learning and systems
- Paper reading and small experimental projects

The goal of this repository is to build solid, traceable foundations and research readiness through continuous learning and practice.
