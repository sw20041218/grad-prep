# Graduate Preparation Learning Plan

This document outlines my learning plan for the first 3–6 months of graduate-level preparation in computer science.

The goal is to systematically strengthen foundational knowledge, develop research-oriented thinking, and gradually align with my supervisors' research directions.

## Phase 1: Foundation Reinforcement (Month 1)

**Objective:** Build solid foundations required for graduate study.

### Mathematics
- Linear algebra: vector spaces, linear mappings, eigenvalues, SVD
- Probability theory: random variables, expectation, variance, common distributions

Focus on understanding concepts intuitively and through simple implementations.

### Computer Science Fundamentals
- Operating systems: processes, threads, memory management
- Computer networks: basic TCP/IP mechanisms
- Programming for research: Python for experiments and scripting

---

## Phase 2: Research-Oriented Learning (Months 2–3)

**Objective:** Transition from foundational learning to research-oriented understanding.

### Machine Learning
- Core concepts: regression, classification, loss functions, optimization
- Neural networks: MLP, CNN, Transformer (structural understanding)

### Systems Awareness
- Training vs inference
- Efficiency, memory usage, and basic parallelism concepts

Small-scale experiments and re-implementations will be conducted to reinforce understanding.

## Phase 3: Exploration and Alignment (Months 4–6)

**Objective:** Gradually align with specific research directions.

- Paper reading: one paper per week with structured summaries
- Small projects: reproduction or simplified exploration of research ideas
- Reflection: identifying gaps and potential research questions

This phase emphasizes learning how to ask good questions and design small experiments.

## Learning Principles

- Emphasis on understanding rather than speed
- All learning activities should leave traceable artifacts (notes, code, summaries)
- Continuous reflection and adjustment of the plan

This plan will be updated as my understanding deepens and research directions become clearer.
